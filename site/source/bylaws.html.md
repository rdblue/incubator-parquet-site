## Apache Parquet Bylaws

This document defines the bylaws under which the Apache Parquet community operates. In general, the community functions as a typical Apache community. These bylaws clarify how that structure works for the Parquet project.

### Committers

Committer access is by invitation only and must be approved by [consensus][consensus-def] of the active PMC members.
